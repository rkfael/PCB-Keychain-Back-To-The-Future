<h1 align="center"> Back To The Future PCB Keychain </h1>

<h2 align="center"> Short Articles Series </h2>

A creative idea for PCB art design.

I designed this PCB keychain using EasyEDA software and then ordered it online from [*JLCPCB*](https://jlcpcb.com/?from=RMW)

You can customize the fabrication according to your preferences for color, thickness, PCB material, and more.
